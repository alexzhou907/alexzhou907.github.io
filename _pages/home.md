I will be starting as a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where I have been working with Prof. Jiajun Wu. I previously received my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at University of California, Los
Angeles and was advised by Prof. Song-Chun Zhu and Prof. Ying-Nian Wu. I research in artificial intelligence and I am broadly interested in creating computer agents that can
understand and represent the world with high-level abstraction. Towards this end, I study computer vision and machine learning, and I aim to investigate visual perception (with or without other modalities) to model
the world in a structured and probablistic manner. My current interests are generative modeling, representation learning, and Bayesian inference.

Besides my research, I play the piano and paint, and I love music and visual arts in general.
