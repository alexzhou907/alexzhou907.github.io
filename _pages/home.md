I am a first year Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I previously received my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics at University of California, Los Angeles and was advised by Prof. Song-Chun Zhu and Prof. Ying-Nian Wu. 
My goal is to create human-centered embodied agents that can understand the world like humans do. Towards this end, I mainly research in computer vision and machine learning, and build models that understand the world in a structured and probablistic manner. I am
broadly interested in representation learning, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning, both in unimodal and multimodal settings.

Besides my research, I play the piano and paint, and I love music and visual arts in general.
